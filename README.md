| status | route            | detail                                                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| âœ…     | `/`              | Default and featured characters are presented. User may search for characters via the header |
| âœ…     | `/character/:id` | View a specific character's details.                                                         |
| ðŸš§     | `/profile`       | Began stubbing out inputs but ran outta steam.                                               |

- âœ… = completed other than styling adjustments.
- ðŸš§ = under construction/incomplete.

## Decisions

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for framework. Many concepts are still fresh in my head from recent projects. Would have otherwise chosen NextJS.
- [`@tanstack/svelte-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/svelte/overview), a svelte flavor of the asynchronous state manament library FKA [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). Provided lots of nice features that make fetching data nicer. I have previous experience with `react-query`, however the svelte flavor required more fiddling than I am fond of. One of the reasons I wish I chose NextJS since the react hooks are far more straight forward to begin using.
- [`zod`](https://zod.dev/) for schema definitions and data validation. This helped with some type coersion issues that I ran into while dealing with `@tanstack/svelte-query`.
- Stuck with Vanilla CSS and using SvelteKit's scoped styles to keep styling simple. Will probably use TailwindCSS in the future since it makes much of the flexbox styling easier/more intuitive.

## Known issues

- Featured Character "View Profile" links update the browsers address bar but do not load character profile page. The link _does_ however work on cards on the main page (i.e. default characters and search results). They should behave identically since they are created by the same component. I am currently stumped but would welcome a discussion on what may be happening here since I have yet to encounter an issue like this with SvelteKit.
- Styles are not mobile-friendly. This is especially problematic with the "featured characters" section in the footer as it takes up much of the page. I did my best to adhere to the sizes presented in Figma but everything still feels quite tight.
- The user profile page is not complete.
- A11y was not a top priority and no testing was done to verify it's usability with screen readers.
- Minimal error checking.
